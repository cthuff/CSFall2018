R_Sun = 100 R_Earth
1 AU = 200 R_Sun
1 Light Year = 6x10^4 AU
1 Galaxy = 10^5 Light Year
1 Observable Universe = 13.7 x 10^9 Light Years

The Universe 

Normal Matter = 4.4%
	-Matter outside of stars = 3.8%
	-Matter inside of stars = 0.6%
Dark Matter = 25%
Dark Energy = 71%

Dark Matter

Rotation Curve of the Galaxy: 
	-The flat piece of the edge of the galaxy of the rotational curve doesn't make sense.
	-Dark Matter is the reason that galaxies exists. It provided the gravity after the Big Bang. (No stars, galaxies, or planets without dark matter)


The further away a planet is from the sun, the slower it travels around the sun. 
The further away a star is from the center, it still goes fast. (There should be less gravity)

A galaxy really sits in a field of dark matter, which is where most of the gravity comes from. That's why the stars still travel very quickly. 

Gravitational Lensing: The bending of light rays by gravity. (Tells us about a cluster's mass) 

When galaxies collide, dark matter separates from the normal matter. 

Hubble Law: The further a galaxy is, the faster it's moving away from us. (Redshift) This means that space is expanding.
