Planet Detection: 

Extrasolar Planet Detection Methods - 

The disk around the star is where planets are made. 

1. The Doppler Method: The presence of an orbiting planet causes the star ("wobble" to move as seen from Earth. The motion is detected by the Doppler shift of the spectral lines. 
	•Led to the observation of Hot Jupiters! (Reverses the snow line argument of gas giants) 

2. Transit Method: Super Earths! (Uses light curves during planetary transit) A planet like Neptune but at the location of Earth. 

3. Gravitational Lensing: Gravity makes light bend, and we can observe the light changing to find planets.Floating planets can be found that are not connected to any stars.

History of Solar Mass Star:

Cloud +	    	->   ProtoStar	    ->   Planets (Pizza-thing) 
Cold Gas +	     No fusion
Contraction	     Spins faster   ->   Main Sequence 	    ->   Runs out of H at ->  Red Giant 		-> Helium Flash    ->   Surface gets hotter   
due to gravity				 Fusion begins 	 	 core 		      Surface gets colder	   3He -> C		Surface Contracts	
					 Temp = 10^7ºK				      Surface expands		   			Core gets colder	
					 H -> He 				      Core gets hotter					Core Expands 		
										      Core contracts (smaller)


 -> Helium Burning Star ->    Run out of He  ->   Surface gets colder   ->   Double Shell burning 		-> 	Planetary Nebula       ->    	White dwarf 
			      at the core	  Surface expands	     Burning H, He at the same time		puffs into space 	     	Core is diamond from the pressure
						  Core gets hotter	     Doesn't work, no balance			(becomes a cloud again)		No fusion - Dead Star
						  Core contracts 			



The Sun's luminosity will rise to 1000 times its current level - too hot for any life on Earth

Three possible leftovers from the death of a star 
	-Star dies and leaves behind a White Dwarf 
	-Black Hole
	-Neutron Star 


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Black Holes

Chandrasekhar:
 
White Dwarf - 1M Sun - Weight / Size = Earth 
|
(Feed)
|
Neutron Star - More mass than the Sun / Size = City

Protons + electors -> neutrons + neutrinos 
P + e -> n + v


Electrons fight gravity. Electrons lose the fight but Neutrons are fighting gravity. 

Black Holes - If we keep feeding a neutron star, then gravity wins.
What is the size of a black hole? = Singularity (The size is 0)

 White Dwarfs -> less than 1.4 M Sun (about the size of the earth) 
{
 Neutron Star - Between 1.4 and 3M Sun (About the size of a city)
{
 Black Hole - More than 3M Sun (Size = 0)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Twin Paradox: You can travel into the future 

Black holes exist because we can see the x-rays from the materials that the black holes are "eating." The X-rays come from the rings around the black hole: the accretion disk.

Gravitational Lensing: Light is bent around the event horizon (singularity). The light is warped and will make it seem like the light is coming from somewhere where it's not actually. 

Pulsars = neutron stars = lighthouses 
	–Neutron stars are not related to pulsating stars
	-Neutron stars masses are generally the same size as Pulsars 
	-The stars spin so fast that light is emitted from them and it looks like a lighthouse.

Review

Sun Birth: 	150 MSun  -> Largest size a start can be (< 150 becomes too windy)
		0.08 MSun -> Less than 0.08 MSun -> No Fusion (Brown Dwarf = Failed Star)

Star Death:
		15 MSun -> 	More than 15M Sun = A black hole
		5 < M < 15 -> 	Neutron Star
		5 MSun ->	White Dwarf 

Leftover: 	3 MSun ->	You have a black hole 
		1.4 < M < 3 	Neutron Star
		1.4MSun ->	White Dwarf

Nearby Stars: Parallax and Tiragulation 

P -> L -> Distance 
Period -> Luminosity relationship 


Cepheid is a Variable Star

The period of the star is a wave and gets brighter and dimmer.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
REGIONS: 
Cosmic Rays - High Energy particles resulting from the explosions of stars

HII Regions = Hot Gas (Glows)

HI Regions = Cold Gas (Radio Waves) 

DUST:

Dust leads to planets. And when a star explodes they go back to dust. 

Sunsets: Stars in space get redder because of dust. 
When a wave (blue light) is shorter than the particle of interference it will bounce off the particle.
When a wave (red light) is longer than the particle of interference it will go through the particle.
On Earth, smog interferes and reflects any blue light coming from the sun and only the redlight can get through. This is why sunsets appear to be red.
