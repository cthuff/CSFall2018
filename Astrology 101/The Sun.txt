Quiz Question #1: 

The sun isn't solid. It has a size and a mass, but it's more like a ballon. Gravity tries to squeeze the gases, and they in return push back against gravity. Eventually they balance out and the forces are in equilibrium. In the future, it can grow larger. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pieces of the Sun – From Outer to Inner 

Corona: Outermost layer of solar atmosphere that will become solar wind~ 1 Million ºK    
Photosphere: The visible surface of the sun (color of the star). The coolest place on the sun ~ 6000ºK
Convection Zone: This is area directly beneath the photosphere (Think the boil zone). 
Radiation Zone: Energy is transported by photons, where the light is trying to escape. 
Core: Energy is generated by nuclear fusion ~ 15 Million ºK

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nuclear Fusion: Small nuclei stick together to make a bigger one (The sun, stars)

Nuclear Fission: A big nucleus splits into smaller pieces (Nuclear Power Plants / Bombs)

-The sun releases energy by fusing 4 Hydrogen nuclei tint one helium nucleus. 
	–P-P Reaction: 4H -> He + Gamma Rays + neutrinos 
	-Neutrinos: Particles that exist in the atmosphere that have no effect on people. Somewhat difficult to detect.

Inside the sun, neutrinos are faster than light (photons). Energy gradually leaks out of radiation some in form of randomly bouncing photons. High temperature enables nuclear fusion to happen in the core.
