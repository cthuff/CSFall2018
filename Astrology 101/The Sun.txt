Quiz Question #1: 

The sun isn't solid. It has a size and a mass, but it's more like a ballon. Gravity tries to squeeze the gases, and they in return push back against gravity. Eventually they balance out and the forces are in equilibrium. In the future, it can grow larger. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pieces of the Sun – From Outer to Inner 

Corona: Outermost layer of solar atmosphere that will become solar wind~ 1 Million ºK    
Photosphere: The visible surface of the sun (color of the star). The coolest place on the sun ~ 6000ºK
Convection Zone: This is area directly beneath the photosphere (Think the boil zone). 
Radiation Zone: Energy is transported by photons, where the light is trying to escape. 
Core: Energy is generated by nuclear fusion ~ 15 Million ºK

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nuclear Fusion: Small nuclei stick together to make a bigger one (The sun, stars)

Nuclear Fission: A big nucleus splits into smaller pieces (Nuclear Power Plants / Bombs)

-The sun releases energy by fusing 4 Hydrogen nuclei tint one helium nucleus. 
	–P-P Reaction: 4H -> He + Gamma Rays + neutrinos 
	-Neutrinos: Particles that exist in the atmosphere that have no effect on people. Somewhat difficult to detect.

Inside the sun, neutrinos are faster than light (photons). Energy gradually leaks out of radiation some in form of randomly bouncing photons. High temperature enables nuclear fusion to happen in the core. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sunspots: Cooler then other parts of the Sun 4000ºK. They are strong magnetic fields (they appear in pairs on the Sun with a North and South magnetic pair). They appear due to the twisting and winding of the Sun's magnetic field. 

Charged particles streaming from the Sun can disrupt electrical power fires and disable communication satellites. Solar win strikes atmosphere at the poles and the atmosphere glows. 

Sunspots rise and fall in an 11 year cycle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
L = luminosity of a star

L = 4PiR^2T_s^4 
Luminosity = 4PI * Size of the Star * Surface Temperature of the Star

The brightest star is over 1 million times brighter than the sun 
The dullest stars are 1/10000th of the brightness of the sun

O B A F G K M 
Hottest -> Coldest
