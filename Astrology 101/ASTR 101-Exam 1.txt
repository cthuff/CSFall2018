Kepler: Used observations made by Tycho Brahe to develop the three laws of planetary motion.
	-First Law: The orbit of each planet around the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at 
	one focus. 
	-Second Law: As a planet moves around its orbit, it sweeps out equal area in equal 
	times. (A planet travels faster when it is nearer to the Sun and slower when it's 
	further away from the sun. 
	-Third Law: More distant planets orbit the Sun at slower average speeds with the 
	relationship p^2 = a^3. (p = orbital period / a = avg distance from the Sun in AU) 
Galileo: First astronomer to use a telescope. Found moons around Jupiter. Not everything revolves around the Earth. 

Newton:
