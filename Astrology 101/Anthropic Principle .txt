Anthropic Principle: The fact that humans exist explains a lot of the overservations about the universe 

Anthropocentric principle = Religion (Not this class)

Earth = Habitable 
Galaxy = Habitable
Universes = Habitable because we are in it

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Big Bang: 

-Hubble Law: The universe is expanding 
-Cosmic Microwave Background: 3ºK (Temperature of the universe) 
	•From the ripples of the Big Bang, we can obtain the best data about cosmology

->Abundances of Hydrogen, Helium and Lithium (All came from the Big Bang) 
->Globular Clusters: 10^10 years old. (We know this because the blue stars blew up)
->Galaxies are turning red
->Irregular galaxies - fewer of them with time 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Why is the Sky Dark at Night? 

Olber's Paradox: If the universive were...
1. Infinite 
2. Unchanging 
3. Everywhere the Same

Then stars would cover the night sky (The sky would be glowing)

-The universe cannot be infinite and unchanging 

Big Bang
•Dark Ages: The time after the BB but before stars formed 
	30K–10K (cold) = Star Formation
-It's possible that everywhere we look there is no star because of the Dark Ages 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A collapsing universe is ruled out because of the ways supernovas work
-Type IA Supernova: Tells us that the expansion of the universe is speeding up
	-DARK ENERGY

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dark Energy is doing the opposite of dark energy. 
-Dark energy forces the universe into an accelerating universe. Dark energy is part of empty space and because the universe is expanding there is more empty space. 

Recombination -> When protons and electrons join together (3,000 K)
Reionization -> xMas tree is lighting up (Adding charges all over again)
Universe started out very hot, and now with more space it's started to cool down 

Inflation: The universe exploded and it's hard to tell how big it was when it first started
